## Project Overview

This project presents the design and simulation of a rectangular microstrip patch antenna operating at 2.45 GHz using Ansys HFSS.

The antenna was analyzed in terms of:
- S11 (Return Loss)
- 3D Realized Gain
- 2D Radiation Pattern (Phi = 0° and 90°)
- Half Power Beamwidth (HPBW)
